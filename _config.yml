intro: |
   With 7+ years of Experience, I have <b>significant experience working across a range</b> of Cyber Security activities, including strong background of <b>Risk assessment</b> for projects, third party, applications to compliance for the organisation. I have good grasp on the frameworks such as <b>ISO 27001, PCI-DSS</b> and had multiple opportunities to get organisation certified by handling end to end activities involved in process.</br></br>
   I also enjoy working on shell scripts for Automation and Forensically Investigating the Cyber Security Incidents to uncover the real <b>intent</b> of an attack/Hack. I like the Automation approach wherever it is possible to implement and promote the DevSecOps culture whenever I get opportunity on. </br></br> <b>Dedicating my</b> efforts towards literature to understand the <b>root cause of Cyber Security events and Hackers perspective/behaviour</b> is a passion of mine.  <b>I also hold myself to a high standard when it comes to listening to a problem statement and working to deliver the right solution/practice for my clients</b>.</br></br> 
   I have worked on my <a href="https://www.github.com/udayom" target="_blank">GitHub Profile</a> to provide an overview of my <b>career history and expertise</b> here. You can also find more information here on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udayom/" taget="_blank">LinkedIn Profile</a>
